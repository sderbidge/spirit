            The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ and confirms
            the truths found in the Holy Bible. Far from undermining the Bible,
            the Book of Mormon supports its testimony of Jesus Christ. One
            passage says that the Book of Mormon “shall establish the truth” of
            the Bible “and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and
            people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and
            the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or
            they cannot be saved” (1 Nephi 13:40).

          <p>
            In its more than 6,000 verses, the Book of Mormon refers to Jesus
            Christ almost 4,000 times and by 100 different names: “Jehovah,”
            “Immanuel,” “Holy Messiah,” “Lamb of God,” “Redeemer of Israel,” and
            so on.

            Both volumes of scripture are a compilation of teachings as recorded
            by ancient prophets. While the Bible details events in the eastern
            hemisphere, the Book of Mormon documents the lives of the
            inhabitants of the ancient Americas.

            The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of
            prophecy and revelation. “Their words, written on gold plates, were
            quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal
            ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his
            resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines
            the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace
            in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who
            translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now
            published in many languages as a new and additional witness that
            Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come
            unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be
            saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder
            in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the
            Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who
            pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its
            truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni
            10:3–5.)
          </p>
          <p>
            “Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also
            come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of
            the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these
            last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
            is the Lord’s kingdom once again established on the earth,
            preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah” (from the
            Introduction of the Book of Mormon).
