            The Doctrine and Covenants is a collection of divine revelations and
            inspired declarations given for the establishment and regulation of
            the kingdom of God on the earth in the last days. Although most of
            the sections are directed to members of The Church of Jesus Christ
            of Latter-day Saints, the messages, warnings, and exhortations are
            for the benefit of all mankind and contain an invitation to all
            people everywhere to hear the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ,
            speaking to them for their temporal well-being and their everlasting
            salvation.

            Most of the revelations in this compilation were received through
            Joseph Smith Jr., the first prophet and president of The Church of
            Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Others were issued through some
            of his successors in the Presidency (see headings to D&amp;C 135,
            136, and 138, and Official Declarations 1 and 2).

            The book of Doctrine and Covenants is one of the standard works of
            the Church in company with the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, and
            the Pearl of Great Price. However, the Doctrine and Covenants is
            unique because it is not a translation of an ancient document, but
            is of modern origin and was given of God through His chosen prophets
            for the restoration of His holy work and the establishment of the
            kingdom of God on the earth in these days. In the revelations, one
            hears the tender but firm voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking
            anew in the dispensation of the fulness of times; and the work that
            is initiated herein is preparatory to His Second Coming, in
            fulfillment of and in concert with the words of all the holy
            prophets since the world began.
